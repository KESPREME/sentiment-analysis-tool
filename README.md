Analyze the sentiment of text using this simple yet powerful web application built with Streamlit and the Transformers library.  Quickly assess the emotional tone of your text data from anywhere with a web browser.

## Features

* **Sentiment Classification:** Analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of user-provided text.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  Interact with the sentiment analysis model through a clean and intuitive Streamlit web application.
* **Pre-trained Models:** Leverages the power of pre-trained models from the Transformers library for accurate and efficient sentiment analysis. (Specific model used will be documented in a future update.)
* **Robust Error Handling:**  Handles missing dependencies gracefully, providing informative messages to the user.
* **Potential for Visualization:** (Future Enhancement)  Visual representation of results using Matplotlib is planned for future releases.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Streamlit:**  Used to build the interactive web application.
* **Transformers (Hugging Face):**  Provides the pre-trained sentiment analysis models.
* **(Potential) Matplotlib:**  For future visualization capabilities.
